Everybody grove to the music
Everybody jam

Oh, hey

Straight up funky when I get with you
Keep it ruthless when I get wet
Keep the party packed in my corner
Tough like granite to keep the crowd hype
Get up on this just to get right

1,"album: ""Backstreet Boys"" (1995)",Anywhere For You,"

I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you asked me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to

I'd walk halfway around the world
For just one kiss from you
Far beyond the call of love
The sun, the stars, the moon
As long as your love's there to lead me
I won't lose my way believe me
Even through the darkest night you know

[Chorus:]
I'd go anywhere for you
Anywhere you asked me to
I'd do anything for you
Anything you want me to
Your love as far as I can see
Is all I'm ever gonna need
There's one thing for sure
I know it's true
Baby, I'd go anywhere for you

I used to think that dreams were just
For sentimental fools
And I'd never find someone
Who'd give their love so true
But I knew the very minute
Couldn't live my life without you in it
And now I want the whole wide world
To know

[Chorus]

Hey baby, hey baby, hey baby, oh [3x]

Baby, I know you're hurting
Right now you feel like you could never
Love again
Now all I ask is for a chance
To prove that I love you

From the first day
That I saw your smiling face
Honey, I knew that we would
Be together forever
Ooh when I asked you out
You said no but I found out
Darling that you'd been hurt
You felt like you'd never love again
I deserve a try honey just once
Give me a chance and I'll prove this all wrong
You walked in, you were so quick to judge
But honey he' s nothing like me

I'll never break your heart
I'll never make you cry
I'd rather die than live without you
I'll give you all of me

Listen girl I don't know where to start

Girl I'd do anything
For one more chance (one more chance)
Cuz I want you back again (want you back)

Cuz everytime I close my eyes
I see your face and I wonder
When you close your eyes

You're all that I see

You and I shared a life together
Each other, was all we'd ever need (all we'd ever need)
I thought you would stay with me forever

The love you gave to me
I keep on tryin' (keep on tryin')
'Til the end ('til the end)

Until I feel your touch
Until you let me come back to you I'm in love with you

I think about you girl everynight
I'm in love and it feels so right
I never meant to hurt you or cause you pain
I was just caught up in that lying game
But now those days are over
I've changed my ways
And now I'm countin' the minutes
I'm countin' the days
Until you let me come back
Until you let me start
To find a new way to get back into your heart

Baby, can I talk to you?
I know something's wrong
Things just ain't the same
But deep down inside
I know you still care
So tell me what to do
To get things back
The way they used to be

If you were my lover
A constant friend to me
Tell me why
Would you turn away from my love

If you listen to me girl
If you know how I'm feeling inside
Then maybe you wouldn't shut me out your life, baby

Can't you see?
All I'm asking for

Even listening to a word you say?
That's okay babe, just tell me your problems
I'll try my best to kiss them all away
Does he leave (does he leave) when you need him the most?
Does his friends get all your time?
Baby please
I'm on my knees
Praying for the day that you'll be mine

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
To you... (hey girl) hey girl, I don't want you to cry no more inside
All the money in the world could never add up to all the love
I have inside... I love you

And I will give it to you
All I can give, all I can give
Everything I have is for you
But love is all I have to give

[Chorus (3x)]

But my love is all I have to give
Without you I don't think I can live
I wish I could give the world to you
But love is all I have to give... to you

Guilty roads to an endless love (endless love)

It takes a lot to know what is love
It's not the big things, but the little things
That can mean enough
A lot of prayers to get me through
And there is never a day that passes by
I don't think of you
You were always there for me
Pushing me and guiding me
Always to succeed

[Chorus:]
You showed me
When I was young just how to grow
You showed me
Everything that I should know
You showed me
Just how to walk without your hands
Cuz mom you always were
The perfect fan

God has been so good
Blessing me with a family
Who did all they could
And I've had many years of grace
And it flatters me when I see a smile on your face
I wanna thank you for what you've done
In hopes I can give back to you
And be the perfect son

[Chorus]

You showed me how to love
You showed me how to care
And you showed me that you would always be there
I wanna thank you for that time
And I'm proud to say you're mine

[Chorus]

Cuz mom you always were,
Mom you always were
Mom you always were,
You know you always were
Cuz mom you always were... the perfect fan

I love you Mom

[Girl:] ""Hello?""
[AJ:] ""Hi. It's me. What's up, baby? I'm sorry. Listen, I'm gonna be late tonight. So, don't stay up and wait for me. OK?""
[Girl:] ""Where are you?""
[AJ:] ""Wait, wait. Say that again?""
[Girl:] ""Hello?""
[AJ:] ""You're really dropping out. I think my battery must be low. Listen, if you can hear me we're goin' to a place nearby. Alright? Gotta go.""

Let me tell you the story about the call that changed my destiny.
Me and my boys went out just to end up in misery.
Was about to go home when there she was standing in front of me
And said, ""Hi.
I got a little place nearby.
Wanna go?""
I should have said, ""No.
Someone's waiting for me,""
But I called my girl up and said,

""Listen, baby, I'm sorry.
Just wanna tell you don't worry.
I will be late. Don't stay up and wait for me
Say again. You're dropping out. My battery is low.
Just so you know: we're goin' to a place nearby.
Gotta go.""

Now two years gone.
Nothing's been won.
I can't take it back. What's done is done.
One of her friends found out
That she wasn't my only one.
And it eats me from inside
That she's not by my side
Just because I made that call and lied,

""Listen, baby, I'm sorry.
Just wanna tell you don't worry.
I will be late. Don't stay up and wait for me.
Say again. You're dropping out. My battery is low.
Just so you know: we're going to a place nearby.
Gotta go.""

Listen, baby, I'm sorry.

Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow

Hold me now, don't bother
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part,
Kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Sadness is beautiful, loneliness is tragical
So, help me, I can't win this war, oh no

Touch me now, don't bother
If every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part,
Kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

I'm here with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart

I'm lookin' back on things I've done
I never wanna play the same old part
Or keep you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Lookin' back on the things I've done
I was tryin' to be someone
I played my part,
Kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart

Lookin' back on the things I've done

I see it in your eyes, 
it always starts the same way
It seems like everyone we know,
is breaking up
Does anybody ever stay in love, anymore?

I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again
With everything I am

when you think I'm not aware
You're searching for clues,
of just how deep my feelings are.
How do you prove the sky is blue, the oceans wide?
All I know is how I feel,
when I look into your eyes

I promise you,
from the bottom of my heart
I will love you till death do us part
I promise you as a lover and a friend
I will love you like I never love again

That's what you always say to me
But late at night I feel the tremble in your touch
Oh what I'm trying to say to you,

You see me sitting here, a smile upon my face
The time has come but you know that it's not too late
There's been too many things, together we have seen
It's not that hard if we start to believe
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we, fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight?
We'll find, the answer to our life

This world is not at ease, we seem to hide the truth
Thinking there's only so much we can really do
It's up to you and me, to face our destiny
The jury's here so let's take the stand
And we're not gonna take anymore
Can we try to erase all the pain
So Please

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we, fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight?
We'll find, the answer to our life

Tell me why we have to cry
And not try
When there's so many things we can do
To help this troubled world start a new

I need a reason, I need a sign
There's no turning back I'm here by your side
Is it today or maybe tonight?
We'll find
The answer to our life
Show me the way, give me a sign
Tell me the way we fall out of line
Is it today, is it tonight
The answer to our life

Show me a reason, give me a sign
Tell me the way we, fall out of line
Is it today or is it tonight?

You can't hide it with a lie

To the truth between the lines

Don't give loneliness a chance

Don't you see it's now or never

Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

All the doors are closing I'm tryin' to move ahead
And deep inside I wish it's me instead
My dreams are empty from the day, the day you slipped away

I just want you to know that I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

That since I lost you, I lost myself
No I can't fake it, there's no one else

I just want you to know
That I've been fighting to let you go
Some days I make it through and then there's nights that never end
I wish that I could believe that there's a day you'll come back to me
But still I have to say I would do it all again
Just want you to know

That I've been fighting to let you go

Everybody knows that I was such a fool to ever let go of you
Baby I was wrong
Yeah I know I said we'd be better off alone
It was time that we moved on
I know I broke your heart, I didn't mean to break your heart
But baby here I am

Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you

I know you're in there and you can make me wait
But I'm not goin' away
It's the least that I can do, just to tell you face to face
I was lying to myself, now I'm dying in this hell
Girl I know you're mad, I can't blame you for being mad
But baby here I am

Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and now I'm crawling back to you
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in?
I was running from the truth and now I'm crawling back to you

If you could see these tears I'm crying
Touch these hands that can't stop shaking
Hear my heart that's barely beating
You will see a different man

But baby here I am
Banging on your front door
My pride spilled on the floor
My hands and knees are bruised and I'm crawling back to you (come on)
Begging for a second chance
Are you gonna let me in? (let me in)
I was running from the truth, now I'm crawling back to you

Banging on your front door (darling)

She could make alone look pretty
Her attitude made a part of the landscape
Riding her bike through Alphabet City
She likes to party in the backseat
Under the bridge on the Brooklyn side
Smoking cigarettes in the afterglow
Taking bets that the sun won't rise

She said, ""what good is tomorrow without a guarantee?""
She can lick her lips and smile
And make you wannabelieve

That your life is just a chain reaction taking you day by day

Ride alongside the rich and famous
Get in elevators, press emergency stop

And when this whole world gets too crazy
And there's nowhere left to run

You're the only truth I know

The angle of your chin when you were looking back

See, god you’re beautiful and I’m still coming down
I’d like a one-night stand, that had to stick around
But I’m still floating on the perfume you left on my sheets
I haven’t changed a thing since your goodbye to me

Tonight I stare out the window…
Knowing I’ll never again be alone

Last night you changed my life
And I was stuck in the moment that you kissed me the first time
Last night you saved my life with your love
Saved my life

Your fingernails running down my spine
All day I hear your voice like velvet in my mind
It’s like I knew you all my life even though we just met
My children in your eyes, something you don’t expect

I had to stop myself from calling all day long
I’m glad you called me first, I wanted to be strong
But you were laughing because I answered after just one ring
I tried to play it off
But you knew everything

She keeps her secrets
In her eyes
She wraps the truth
Inside her lies
Just when I can't say
What she's done to me
She comes to me
And leads me back to paradise

She's so hard to hold
But I can't let go

[Chorus]
I'm a house of cards
in a hurricane
A reckless fire
In the pouring rain
She cuts me and the pain
Is all I wanna feel
She'll dance away just like a child
She drives me crazy
Drives me wild
But I'm helpless when she smiles

[Howie]
She smiles

Maybe I'd fight if I could
It hurts so bad
But feels so good
She opens up just like
A rose to me
When she's close to me
Anything she'd ask me to
I would

It's out of control
But I can't let go

When she looks at me
I get so weak

I need you next to me
There's nowhere to run
Girl I can't let you go
And it's twisted I know
But I just can't take it no more

Six miles, twelve lights till your front door
I'm on my way just like I have so many times before
Does he know that it's me you've been talking to?
Shame, shame, shame

If you could read my mind
I'm gonna fight to get you back this time

Cos I'm as sick as my secrets
Yeah, it's killing me
You know that I mean it
I need you next to me
There's nowhere to run
Girl I can't let you go
And it's twisted I know
But I just can't take it no more

I'm tired of all these lies
There's nothing but regret behind these eyes
All this love I could never show
I don't care any more
Give a damn who knows

Cos I'm as sick as my secrets
Yeah, it's killing me
You know that I mean it
I need you back with me
There's nowhere to run
Girl I can't let you go
And it's twisting my soul
But I just can't take it no more

Sick as my secrets
Yeah, it's killing me
You know that I mean it
I need you next to me
There's nowhere to run (nowhere to run)
Girl I can't let you go (nowhere to hide)
And it's twisted I know
But I just can't take it no more

Yeah, I just can't leave you alone
Yeah, yeah
Tired of all the lies
Oh babe you've got me stripped of my pride
Gonna shout it from a mountain top
Yeah, drain the oceans from the tears we've cried
Gonna break down these walls
Gonna stand tall
Gonna be your man
Hope you understand, oh
That I'll never let you go

In the heart
Of the night
When it's dark
In the lights
I heard the loudest noise
A gunshot on the floor

[Nick:]
I looked down
And my shirt's turning red
I'm spinning around
Felt her lips on my neck
And her voice
In my ear
Like I missed you
Want you tonight

[All:]
Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me
I just can't believe it

No, I can't resist
And I can't be hit
I just can't escape this love
Straight through my heart
Soldier down (my heart)
Soldier down (my heart)

[Howie:]
Thought I moved
More than on
Thought I could
Fool her charm
I really wanna go
But I can't leave her alone

[AJ:]
Hear the sound
Of a love so loud
I just can't
I just can't
Ignore this feeling
Said she misses me
And she wants me
Wants me tonight

Straight through my heart
A single bullet got me
I can't stop the bleeding
Straight through my heart
She aimed and she shot me

First off I cant keep a promise
I'm no one to count on at all
Add on that I'm a coward
Too scared to return your calls

[Chorus]
But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger
Lalala
Cuz you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger
Than me
Lalala

Its known that I'm a liar
Often they're blacker than white
Add on my uncanny ego
No ones less humbled than I

But you don't care
You keep sticking around
While I'm acting a clown
You're bigger
Lalala
Cuz you're still here
Your feet stuck to the ground
Despite how silly it sounds
You're bigger

All the messed up things I do
Yeah I swear I'll make'em up to you
Before you go and have enough
Just let me make it better
I'll try to measure up
I'll try to measure up to you

I'll make it up to you

Life should be like a game of cards
You make a mistake
Shuffle the deck and start over
It should be just like driving in your car
Get lost and your navigation system
Gets you closer

[Pre-chorus:]
But there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
Cause once you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back
Letting you go

[Chorus:]
If I knew then
What I know now
I wouldn't have said
I don't need you around
Alone in this mess
Silence is so loud
So I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
What I know now (What I know now)
Yeah I would treat you the best
Baby if I knew then
What I know now

Life should come with remote controls
Then I just rewind it to
The time it was better
It should have a restart button
So, I could travel right back
To the day that I met her

[Pre-chorus]

[Chorus]

Cause there ain't no handbook
You're on your own
Got no instructions
When it comes to love
See once you do something
Can't be undone
Wish I could take back

Don't know the meaning of pretending of what to do

I could be the one
Give you all my love
Forget what he has done to you
I'm here now
Open up to me
Love will set you free
If ever you believe it
Please believe in me
This is us, this is us
This is us, this is us
This is love, this is love
Let the world know, baby (This is us)

Let the world know, baby (This is us)

I know everything isn't meant to last
Box up all those photographs
You're moving on (yeah)
I could flip back over that hour glass
And refill the better half (the better half)

And it's a miracle how broken hearts can mend
Won't you dry up all those tear drops and start again

If I could show you there's no risk of being left alone
Would you let your past go
I'll take it slow
Cause there's no need to rush when I know

Intimate scenes
Fresh from my dreams
Over a triple X movie screen
I couldn't care less about being seen
A higher self esteem if you're on me?
(Ain't that the way it's supposed to be?)
I say baby do you think
Sugar so sweet should rot my teeth
But instead it just rottens me
Spoiled crazy

Public display of affection
(Gotta make 'em)
Pointing in my direction
(Watch me, watch me)
Public display of affection
Makes them wish they had it this way

We'd be at the club, the restaurant, the grocery store or the movies
Kissing and touching with my hands all over your booty
Wherever it is, we is, I love it truly
Your PDA hey hey
(I want your PDA)
Your PDA, hey hey
(I want your PDA)
Your PDA hey hey

Remember at the beach we brought the sheets
We were harassed by police
Good thing we didn't go too deep
Everywhere we be the passion in me just screams
I just need you in my reach
Baby your suspense can be intense
It's got me convinced, oh yeah
You're the fingers to my instrument

Public display of affection

Pointing in my direction

And we're so compatible
From the Starbucks to the Navo

Listen up 

This scene's so hypnotic 
Smoking mirrors, lights and magic 
Paper faces in gold 
There's solider boys, beauty queens 
Everyone's a mystery 
It's got me losing control 

Yearning, I'm yearning for the one to steal my eyes 
Wanna play in this game of disguise 

It's a masquerade, a love parade 
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All through the night and day 
My masquerade, I need you baby 
So stay with me tonight 

Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade 
Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade 

Just like a perfect dream 
I don't ever wanna leave 
A thousand freaks in the show 
One's a tiger, one's a lynx 
One's a king that suffering 
Moving high, moving low 
Burning, I'm burning, can't you see it in my eyes? 
Wanna play in this game of disguise 

It's a masquerade, a love parade 
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All through the night and day 
My masquerade, I need you baby 
So stay with me tonight 

Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade 
Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade, Masquerade 

I gotta know the girl behind the mask 
Let me in, where you've been, don't pretend 
Dreamed that I had her alone 
Show your face to me, we could be everything 

It's a masquerade, a love parade 
So won't you stay and dance with me 
All through the night and day

Every time I close my eyes 
you're the first thing that runs to my mind 
Everywhere I go 
I see you 
hear you 
feel you 
I just wanna be near you 
and heal? you 
Last thing you said is how dare you 
First thing I said is I'm sorry 
Now I'm sitting here 
helpless 
man 
Same old story 

Now she's brokenhearted 
Time heals all the wounds 
She said 
Not this time 
It's true 
Everyone plays a fool 
And that fool is me 
Because I foolishly 
took advantage of a woman who loved me 

I fall in love all over again 
each time 
I lay my eyes on you 
I pretend 
I feel so helpless 
without you 
feel so helpless 
without you 
It takes a piece of me 
each time you leave 
I feel it in my chest 
so hard to breathe 
I feel so helpless 
without you 
I feel so helpless 
without you 

ohh yeah

And wonder where the ships would go
Who was on and what they would find out
You wrote it in a notebook
And said someday that this would be a story to tell
And you’d put it in a movie, maybe be the movie star
Something stole your tears and wiped your smile away

Is it too much to ask for
One minute to breathe
Cause you take my breath away
Like I'd never sink

You're the reason why cave men drew on the walls
The reason why after every summer we fall

You're the reason I never wanna sleep at night
Cause nothing that I could dream
Is better than you by my side

You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I,
I'm so in love I can die right now and be fine, I need you tonight
You know that I love somebody, love somebody

When you wake up with no make up
You try hiding your face,
You know that I, and it's so cute,
You don't even know
How beautiful you are to me

You're the reason why cave men drew on the wall
It's the reason why after every summer we fall
And the way that you look in those purple jeans
It's still the sexiest thing that I've ever seen

You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I love somebody, love somebody
You know that I
I'm so in love I can die right now and be fine I need you tonight
You know that I love somebody, love somebody

You wear the jersey of my favorite team

Hard to believe it's almost a year since
I've got to hold your head on my shoulder
Dodging the daylight, taking the blame like
It's all I've got left, so lately I've spent

Every single night like it's 25 to life
And this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven
And I'm guilty as charged 'cause I went and broke your heart
But even I've got rights, you're always gonna be my

One, always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging, ""Pretty baby please come home.""
'Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call

First time it rings
I can't help but think of the first time I saw you
That moment I knew
Holding the phone tight, I hear the tone twice
If you just pick up, swear I can fix us

Every single night feels like 25 to life
And this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven
And I'm guilty as charged 'cause I went and broke your heart
But even I've got rights, you're always gonna be my

One, always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging, ""Pretty baby please come home.""
'Cause you're my one
Always be my one phone call

So let me make my case
And pray you won't erase
The message that I'm leaving for you now
But if you do
At least you knew...

'Cause you're my one...
Always be my one phone call
All I want,
All I need is one phone call
I'm gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging, ""Pretty baby please come home.""

Been down the back roads
Where the girls are homegrown
That southern dame’s so
Sexy how they talk slow
And something happens in the woods of Kentucky
Drinking moonshine, bon fire, pour the gasoline

Farther south, where the sweet tequila flows
Tiny clothes, Yo te amo, México
Señoritas, we are sippin’ margaritas on the beach
They got something you can’t teach

[Chorus:]
I’ve been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo,
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home

Rock out in Bangkok, where the party, don’t stop
Eyes open, blood shot
Seeing things I’d never thought
Sweatin’ in the heat
God I love the way they speak
Burning up the streets, dancing like a freak

[Chorus:]
I’ve been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo,
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home

So many things to see
So many eyes to meet
I couldn’t count them all if I had eternity
So I just want you to know
Everywhere that I go
You take a piece of me

Beijing, Stockholm, Buenos Aires, to tango
Moscow, Cape Town, showed us how to get down
London, Berlin, this is where it all began
San Juan, Sydney, can’t forget the NYC

[Chorus:]
I’ve been all around, all round the world
Every single part, every part of the world
Touching down in Rio, Monaco, LA, Tokyo,
But it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home
And it all just feels like home
And it all still feels like home

Seen the sun setting on the beach in Mexico
But I could care less, 'cause I was all alone
And there ain't no way to touch your body over the phone

But you'll always be the home I wanna come home to
You're a wild night with a hell of a view
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you
There ain't no place, ain't no place like you

You're my daybreak, you're my California sun
You're my Memphis, New York, New Orleans all rolled into one
In the city, the country, the mountains or sea

You look happy, happier than I do
Your hair's a little longer
Am I crazy, is it blonder than it was then?
When you walked down on my house
I didn't say a thing, now
It's funny how a year can fill you head with should've, would've, could've been

Took my words, wrote them down, threw them out
And now there's only five left to tell you

Baby, I want you back
There's a space in my bed
In the shape of your head
I said it, what if I said it?
Baby, I want you back
Would you come back around?
'Cause I need you right now
I said it, there, I said it
Baby, I want you back

Would you meet me at the chateau?
At a table, I'd get your favorite chardonnay, yeah
'Cause babe, you know, a bottle is a little bit too much to drink alone
We could catch up, make out, make up
'Cause I don't wanna go
Another day without you, come on

I gotta say that was my favorite June
And I knew, from that night

Someone like you, I'd take back all those nights I wasted
Looking for the right one at the wrong door

Bad things will happen, but none of that matters
We'll find a way, as long as I'm with you, I'm ok

Just tell me you were on in it
People wanna talk, shut 'em all off
And tell 'em all to mind their business
Will for the grumps and cynics
Been that way from the beginning
People see what they don't have
They get sad and act out 'cause they're winning

Ooh, I love the way you wanna love me too
