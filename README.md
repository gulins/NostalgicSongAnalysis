# Nostalgic Song Analysis

A short analysis on a boy band from the 90s and generating lyrics from their lyrics.

## Setup

The Python packages used in the project are in `requirements.txt`. Download them via **pip** using the command

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Collecting The Data: A Lyrics Scraper**

The data source `lyrics_data_master.csv` was created by running the lyrics scraper [bsblyricscraper.py](bsblyricscraper.py) which is a web scraper coded to extract data on Backstreet Boys albums from the website [AZLyrics](https://www.azlyrics.com/). The code uses delayed requests (between 1-60 second intervals) to avoid getting blocked before some data can be extracted.

## Song Analyser

The `songAnalyser.py` reads in the data from `lyrics_data_master.csv` and does a basic analysis of the lyrics. The same program in a Jupyter notebook style is []()

### Word Count

**Top 10 Word Count**

Words such as a, the, and, from, to, it, that, thats, or, this, of, is, are, am, these are not meaningful and so we can remove them to get a better idea of what are top 10 words used:

### Generated Lyrics

New lyrics are generated by using similar technique to Markov Chains. A unique number of words and the probability of its _followers_ is created and used for to generate a string. There is a total of 2111 unique words with followers. The code also creates and adjacency matrix which we visualised using a free software called Cytoscape. As a result, the graph has 2111 nodes and 12977 edges:

If we focus on one of the top words _love_, and only consider those nodes that are connected to it, then we get a simpler graph:

The following song title and lyrics were generated by the code:

	Breathing My Let
	----------------
	
	Worth it no stronger than you remember those tear us to see
	My side
	Nobody but i had it in love me starts fillin' up all of you, i'm gonna have finished
